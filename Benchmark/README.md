## Benchmark Testing

**1)Benchmark testing was done on the CEC 2015 benchmark functions(24) present in the BBOB suite.**

**2)COCO platform was used for the benchmark testing. The instructions for benchmark tesing can be read from [COCO platform](https://github.com/numbbo/coco)**

**3)DIR:With CLS - contain results obtained from benchmark testing done on the code having chaotic local search incorporated**

**4)DIR:Without CLS- contain results obtained from benchmark testing done on code with no CLS - has 2 versions (very similar)**

**5)DIR:Improvement_comparison - contains result of comparison of the performance of 'with cls' and 'without cls' code(by testing on the 
becnhmarks)**

**6)*****testing.py*** - **the benchmark testing code on the hybrid developed**

**7)*****hybrid.py*** - **contains the hybrid algorithm which is used by** ***testing.py*** **for the benchmark testing**

**The benchmark tesing of the algorithm is compared with standard algorithms- GA, DASA, PSO, Rosenbrock, ALPS. [Download](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=algorithms-bbob)**
