## Benchmark Testing

**1)Benchmark testing was done on the CEC 2015 benchmark functions(24) present in the BBOB suite.

**2)COCO platform was used for the benchmark testing. The instructions for benchmark tesing can be read from [COCO platform](https://github.com/numbbo/coco)**

**3)With CLS - benchmark testing done on the code having chaotic local search incorporated**

**4)Without CLS- benchmark testing done on code with no CLS - has 2 versions (very similar)**

**5)Improvement_comparison - compares the results of 'with cls' and 'without cls' code(by testing on the becnhmarks)**

**The benchmark tesing of the algorithm is compared with standard algorithms- GA, DASA, PSO, Rosenbrock, ALPS. [Download](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=algorithms-bbob)**
